# 7Lab assessment
A project to show what my skills are.

## Postman
I used postman to test my API. A link to the collection I used to test can be found here: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/f3b45a67d1420d470372.

Don't forget to change the authentication token in the header of your requests.

## Installation
First run `php artisan migrate` to create the tables you need in your database.

After that run `php artisan db:seed` to create a new user.
